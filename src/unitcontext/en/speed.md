## Common Speed Units Overview & Conversion Table

### Metric Speed Units (International Standard)
Centered on meters per second (m/s) — decimal-based and ideal for science.

| Unit Name             | Symbol | Conversion to m/s                     | Common Applications       |
|-----------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Centimeters per second| cm/s   | 1 cm/s = 0.01 m/s                    | Laboratory fluid dynamics |
| **Meters per second** | m/s    | Base SI unit                         | Fundamental physics       |
| Kilometers per hour   | km/h   | 1 km/h ≈ 0.27778 m/s                 | Road traffic              |
| Mach                  | Mach   | 1 Mach ≈ 343 m/s (standard sea level)| Aerospace                 |

### Imperial, Maritime & Aviation Units
Non-decimal; still dominant in certain regions and industries.

| Unit Name             | Symbol | Conversion to m/s                     | Common Applications       |
|-----------------------|--------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Miles per hour**    | mph    | 1 mph ≈ 0.44704 m/s                  | US/UK road traffic        |
| **Knot**              | kn / kt| 1 kn = 1 nmi/h ≈ 0.51444 m/s         | Maritime, aviation        |
| Feet per second       | ft/s   | 1 ft/s ≈ 0.3048 m/s                  | Ballistics, sports        |

### Other Important Speed Reference Units
| Unit Name             | Symbol | Conversion to m/s                     | Common Applications       |

| Speed of light        | c      | 1 c ≈ 299792458 m/s                  | Fundamental physics       |
| Speed of sound (20°C, sea level) | — | ≈ 343 m/s                         | Aviation reference        |

## History & Origins of Speed Units

### Metric Speed: Unified Scientific & Transport Standard
Metric speed is built around meters per second, stemming from the 1790s French metric reform. As the meter was defined, speed naturally became its time derivative (second from astronomical day). With railways and automobiles in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, km/h became the practical road unit. The SI system later confirmed m/s as the base unit. The Mach number, named after Austrian physicist Ernst Mach (1887), quantifies speed relative to the local speed of sound and is essential for supersonic and hypersonic flow.

### Imperial & Maritime Speed: Tradition Meets Practicality
Miles per hour trace back to the Roman “mile” (1000 paces) and were standardized in medieval England. The knot originated in the 15th–16th centuries when sailors measured speed with a knotted log-line; the number of knots paid out per hour became the ship’s speed. One knot was later fixed at one nautical mile per hour. Despite being non-decimal, mph remains standard on US/UK roads, and knots dominate aviation and maritime (standardized by ICAO post-1950s), ensuring global compatibility and safety.

### Special Speed Units: Physics & Limits
The speed of light c is the universe’s ultimate constant, fixed by Einstein’s 1905 special relativity. Mach number is a dimensionless ratio crucial for distinguishing subsonic, transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic regimes — vital in missile design, spaceflight, and high-speed aerodynamics.

## Practical Speed Reference Values
- 1 km/h ≈ 0.2778 m/s ≈ 0.6214 mph ≈ 0.5400 kn
- Highway speed limit: 120 km/h ≈ 74.6 mph ≈ 64.8 kn
- Commercial airliner cruise: ~850–950 km/h ≈ 0.78–0.85 Mach
- Speed of sound (standard sea level): ≈ 1225 km/h ≈ 761 mph ≈ 661 kn

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- **How to convert km/h to mph?** km/h × 0.621371 ≈ mph
- **What’s the difference between knots and km/h?** 1 kn ≈ 1.852 km/h; knots are the standard for sea and air.
- **What is Mach number?** Ratio of object speed to local speed of sound.
