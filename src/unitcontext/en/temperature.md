## Origins and Development of Temperature Scales

### Celsius – Globally Adopted Practical Scale
The Celsius scale was created in 1742 by Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius. Originally, it set the boiling point of water at 0° and the freezing point at 100°, but it was soon inverted to the modern standard (freezing at 0°, boiling at 100°) for easier everyday observations. In the 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution and expanding international trade, Celsius gradually replaced local scales and became dominant across continental Europe. It was incorporated into the metric system with the 1875 Metre Convention. By the mid-20th century, the United Nations promoted its global standardization. Today, Celsius is the official scale for weather reporting, medicine, and science in nearly every country except a few (notably the United States). Its design based on water’s phase changes makes it easy to reproduce in laboratories, driving advances in thermodynamics and meteorology. It now plays a central role in climate change monitoring.

### Fahrenheit – Regional Traditional Scale
The Fahrenheit scale was developed in 1724 by German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. He set 0° as the freezing point of a brine solution (ammonium chloride) and 96° as normal human body temperature (later adjusted to 98.6°), aiming for fine gradations suitable for cold European climates. In the 18th century, it spread to British colonies and became the core temperature scale of the Imperial/US system. After U.S. independence, America retained Fahrenheit despite the rise of metric units, largely due to strong cultural habit. Mid-20th-century attempts by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards to promote metric failed, so Fahrenheit continues to dominate daily life in the United States (weather, recipes, medicine). Its non-linear formula reflects the limitations of early experimental thermometers. Cross-border travel and international cooking create frequent conversion needs.

### Kelvin / Rankine – Absolute Temperature Scales for Science
The Kelvin scale was proposed in 1848 by British physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) based on the concept of absolute zero, avoiding negative temperatures and defining 0 K as the point where molecular motion theoretically stops. The Rankine scale, created in 1859 by Scottish engineer William Rankine, is the absolute counterpart to Fahrenheit. In the 1960s, Kelvin was adopted as the SI base unit of temperature. In 1967 it was defined using the triple point of water (1/273.16 of that temperature). In 2019, it was redefined in terms of the Boltzmann constant. Kelvin is the standard for physics and chemistry (gas laws, thermodynamics), while Rankine is mainly used in U.S./British engineering (aerospace, energy). These absolute scales enabled major progress in quantum physics, cosmology, and interdisciplinary precision.

## Practical Temperature Reference Values
- Absolute zero: -273.15 °C = -459.67 °F = 0 K
- Normal human body temperature: 37 °C ≈ 98.6 °F
- Freezing / Boiling point of water: 0 °C / 100 °C = 32 °F / 212 °F
- Baking example: 180 °C = 356 °F (common for cakes)
