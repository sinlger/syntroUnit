## History & Origins of Angle Systems

### Degrees vs. Radians: Ancient Tradition Meets Scientific Elegance
The 360° system originated in ancient Babylon (~4000 years ago) using base-60 mathematics, possibly linked to the approximate 360 days in a year; it was later adopted by the Greeks and became the global standard for everyday use. Radians emerged in the late 18th century (developed by Roger Cotes and others) and became standardized in the 19th century with the rise of calculus. Radians define angle via arc length = radius (θ = s/r), removing constants and simplifying derivatives, integrals, and many formulas. Today radians dominate mathematics, physics, computer graphics, and robotics, while degrees remain prevalent in daily life, engineering drawings, and navigation.

### Gradians (gons) & Mils: Practical Innovations for Measurement & Military
Gradians were born during the French Revolution’s metric enthusiasm (1790s), dividing a right angle into 100 gons (400 gons per circle) for easier decimal calculations. Popular in European surveying for a time, they declined in the late 20th century due to incompatibility with the 360° world. The mil (from “milliradian”) has several variants; the modern **NATO mil** (1/6400 of a circle) was promoted by Sweden and the US in the mid-20th century because 1 mil subtends ~1 meter at 1000 m distance — a huge practical advantage for ballistic correction. It is now standard in sniper scopes, fire-control systems, and artillery.

### Small-Angle Units: The Evolution of Precision
Arcminutes and arcseconds come from Babylonian sexagesimal subdivision and remain fundamental in astronomy (e.g., stellar parallax in arcseconds). Milliradians and microradians reflect modern needs in optics, lasers, semiconductors, lithography machines, and gyroscopes — representing the leap from arcsecond to microradian precision.

## Practical Angle Reference Values
- 1 rad ≈ 57.30° ≈ 63.66 gon ≈ 1018.59 mrad
- Right angle: 90° = π/2 rad ≈ 100 gon
- Full circle: 360° = 2π rad ≈ 400 gon ≈ 6400 NATO mil
- Shooting rule of thumb: 1 mil ≈ 10 cm at 100 m

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- **How to convert degrees to radians?** ° × π / 180 = rad
- **Are mil and mrad the same?** Close but not identical — 1 NATO mil ≈ 0.9817 mrad
- **Why do mathematicians prefer radians?** Formulas are simplest; e.g., d(sin x)/dx = cos x only holds in radians.
