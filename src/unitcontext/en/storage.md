### Decimal Storage Units (SI Standard – Commonly Used by Hard Drive Manufacturers)
1000-based (powers of 10) – standard for marketing and labeling hard drives, SSDs, USB drives.

| Unit Name       | Symbol | Relation to Byte (B)              | Common Applications                  |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|

## Origins and Development of Data Storage Unit Systems

### Binary Units (1024-based) – The Authentic Computer System
Computers operate in binary, so early engineers naturally used powers of 2 (1024 = 2¹⁰) for scaling. From the 1960s–1990s, almost all computing contexts (memory, disks, filesystems) treated 1 KB = 1024 bytes, 1 MB = 1024 KB, etc. This remains the true underlying reality in RAM, OS file size reporting, and most programming contexts.

### Decimal Units (1000-based) – Hard Drive Marketing Convention
In the late 1990s, as drive capacities grew rapidly, manufacturers adopted the International System of Units (SI) decimal prefixes (1 KB = 1000 bytes, 1 MB = 1000 KB, etc.) to make advertised numbers appear larger. This creates a ~7–10% discrepancy: a "1 TB" drive actually provides ≈ 931 GiB of usable space. Users often perceive this as "missing capacity," but it is simply a difference in numbering systems.

### Birth of IEC Binary Prefixes (KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.)
In 1998, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published IEC 60027-2, formally introducing binary prefixes: kibi (Ki), mebi (Mi), gibi (Gi), tebi (Ti), etc., to unambiguously represent powers of 1024 and avoid confusion with SI decimal prefixes. After 2000, Linux, macOS, Apple tools, and many programming libraries gradually adopted KiB/MiB/GiB for accurate reporting. Windows still often labels capacities using KB/MB/GB but calculates internally with 1024. In the 2020s, browser download managers (Chrome, Firefox) increasingly show speeds in MiB/s rather than MB/s.

## Practical Storage Reference Values
- 1 GB (decimal) ≈ 0.931 GiB (binary)
- Typical 128 GB smartphone storage ≈ 119.2 GiB actual usable space
- 1 TB hard drive (labeled) ≈ 931 GiB ≈ 953,674 MiB
- A 4K movie ≈ 15–25 GB (≈ 14–23 GiB)
- Full Blu-ray disc (original) ≈ 50 GB (≈ 46.5 GiB)
- Global data creation (estimated 2025–2026) already exceeds 100–200 ZB annually

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- **Why does a 1 TB hard drive show only ~931 GB?** Hard drive makers use decimal (1 TB = 1000 GB), while operating systems use binary (1 TiB = 1024 GiB). The difference is ~7–10%.
- **What’s the difference between KiB/MiB/GiB and KB/MB/GB?** KiB/MiB/GiB are the official IEC binary prefixes (1024-based); KB/MB/GB are often used loosely for decimal (1000-based) marketing.
- **Which system do file sizes in Windows / phone use?** Most OS file explorers and phones display 1024-based values but label them as KB/MB/GB (legacy habit).
- **How to convert download speed MB/s to Mbps?** 1 MB/s (megabytes per second) = 8 Mbps (megabits per second). A 100 Mbps connection ≈ 12.5 MB/s theoretical max download.
