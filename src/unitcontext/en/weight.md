## Origins and Development of Weight Measurement Systems

### Metric Weight (SI) – Standardized Global System
The metric weight system originated in late 18th-century France to resolve chaotic traditional measures that hindered trade. In 1791, the French Academy of Sciences proposed defining the kilogram as the mass of 1 cubic decimeter of pure water. In 1799, a platinum-iridium prototype kilogram was created as the international standard. The decimal structure greatly simplified calculations. The 1875 Metre Convention established the International Bureau of Weights and Measures to maintain it. The 20th century saw multiple refinements: copies of the prototype were distributed in 1889, and in 2019 the kilogram was redefined in terms of the Planck constant, eliminating dependence on a physical artifact. The metric system drives global standardization in industry and science – from microgram-level pharmaceutical precision to tonne-scale logistics – ensuring fairness in international trade.

### US/Imperial Weight – Regional Folk System
US/Imperial weight units trace back to medieval British customs: the pound was originally based on grain weight, the ounce derived from cup measures. Early regional variations were widespread. In the 13th century, royal statutes unified relationships between ounce and pound. British colonial expansion carried these units to North America. In the 19th century, the United States revised standards, creating the short ton (US) and long ton (UK) distinction. The 1959 US–UK agreement aligned conversions with metric (e.g., 1 lb ≈ 0.4536 kg), but the non-decimal nature was preserved. These units still dominate daily life in the US and UK (body weight, groceries), and weight converters must distinguish them to support cross-border e-commerce.

### Chinese Traditional (City) Weight – Culturally Inherited System
Chinese city weight units date back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties, originally based on farming tools (e.g., jin derived from an ancient tool’s weight). During the Spring and Autumn / Warring States periods, regional differences caused inconsistency; Qin Shi Huang unified the jin and liang systems. Subsequent dynasties refined but largely preserved them for agrarian society. In 1929, the Nationalist government’s Weights and Measures Act standardized the jin at 500 grams to align with metric. These units reflect humanistic design and are still used in farmers’ markets and traditional Chinese medicine. Modern converters support their continued cultural relevance.
